CSV: meal name,vegetarian: yes(y)/no(n), type of meal: roast(r)/normal(n)/soup(s), type of meat: beef(b)/pork(p)/fish(f)/chicken(c)/veggie(v)

Notes:
- perhaps a seperate file for "try something new" meals
- could either list all meals matching that criteria or just randomly choose one to be decisive
- need to be able to randomly generate another one if not happy with the first etc
- meal plan should be saved so it can be viewed later
- perhaps automatically gets the week date
- perhaps auto generates a meal plan for the week which mummy can review and edit, or completely scrap
- when creating a new meal plan, perhaps go through each of the days and apply the filters individully or maybe even choose the days to apply the same filer to
- need a shortcut on the desktop which mummy can just double click on and it run the GUI (no CLI as thats less people friendly)
- need a way to update the meals file with new ideas
  - enter the meal name and select the filters it has
  - perhaps auto capitalise all the words except 'and' to be in the same format
  - check the csv file to see if it already exists
  - if any similar items are found, perhaps return it and check the user didnt mean that
- definitely needs a GUI with pygame
  - boxes to check for one or multiple filters
  - can just leave boxes unchecked to show all items in that category
  - perhaps different boxes to check depending on the day
  - should be an option to add a veggie meal for each day
