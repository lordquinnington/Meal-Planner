CSV: meal name,vegetarian: yes(y)/no(n), type of meal: roast(r)/normal(n)/soup(s), type of meat: beef(b)/pork(p)/fish(f)/chicken(c)/veggie(v)

Notes:
- perhaps a seperate file for "try something new" meals
- randomly generate a meal (which isn't a roast unless Sunday)
- could either list all meals matching that criteria or just randomly choose one to be decisive
- need to be able to randomly generate another one if not happy with the first etc
- meal plan should be saved so it can be viewed later
- perhaps automatically gets the week date
- perhaps auto generates a meal plan for the week which mummy can review and edit, or completely scrap
- when creating a new meal plan, perhaps go through each of the days and apply the filters individully or maybe even choose the days to apply the same filer to
- need a shortcut on the desktop which mummy can just double click on and it run the GUI (no CLI as thats less people friendly)
- need a way to update the meals file with new ideas
  - enter the meal name and select the filters it has
  - perhaps auto capitalise all the words except 'and' to be in the same format
  - check the csv file to see if it already exists
  - if any similar items are found, perhaps return it and check the user didnt mean that
- definitely needs a GUI with pygame
  - boxes to check for one or multiple filters
  - can just leave boxes unchecked to show all items in that category
  - perhaps different boxes to check depending on the day
  - should be an option to add a veggie meal for each day
- could also have a shopping list function
  - make a list and remove and add items like normal
  - if you tell it how much of each ingredient goes into each meal, it could make a shopping list of the things needed to make the meals for the week
  - should be able to remove/modify each item it automatically puts on the list
  - could tell it which items are items are regular items (like milk) so it will automatically add them onto the list created for the new week
  - list for each week should be saved so can be referred to later, but lists deleted once no longer needed
- put in requirements for the week, so perhaps one day meat, one day veggie, one day roast, and one day roast and the rest whatever etc etc
- edit button on the meal planner should allow to filter or just generate a new random meal
- edit button on meal planner also needs the option to add a veggie meal
- sunday needs to have roast automatically applied (and the other days not) but still with the option to override it
- perhaps retains the filters with an option to reset them for the meal idea button
- needs to check for repeated items in the meal plan and change them if there is
- default settings for creating a meal plan like sunday => roast, monday => good for leftovers, saturday => veggie idk
- should be able to have a look at next week and the week afters meal plan

GUI Notes:
- could try moving the meal plan closer to the centre and having meal idea on top of random meal idea on top of try something new on top of the suggestion box on top of the meal today box with the date and meal idea. view shopping list and add new item could be on the right of the meal plan in the smaller space
- need to have an add/remove veggie meal on the meal plan
- arrow to move between weeks for the meal plab
